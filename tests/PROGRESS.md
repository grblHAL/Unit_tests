# Coverage progress and continuation handoff

Last verified: **2026-10-13**. Read this with the root `AGENTS.md` and README.
This is a snapshot, not proof that future checkouts or CI runs are unchanged.

## Batch 3 modal and multiple-probe extension

Twelve further cases pass full Windows Clang ASan/UBSan validation:
**2,352 tests, 2,323 clean passes, 29 documented known regressions, no unexpected
failures/skips**; strict summary passes. New cases cover dynamic/static cutter
compensation parameter values, lathe diameter/radius mode, runtime tool selection
and pocket identity, UVW offsets, rotary-unit preservation, three-input probe
state aggregation and extended realtime probe/release indicators.

Four new regression cases document cancelled dynamic compensation reporting 401,
aggregate probe reads changing the selected probe and aggregate reads ignoring
independent toolsetter inversion. Correct assertions and passing controls remain;
no production core edits. Latest measured coverage remains the 2,337-case snapshot
below; these twelve subsequent cases and the three later spindle cases are not
included in that measurement.

Hosted validation of the preceding pushed 2,340-case checkpoint is running:
https://github.com/petervanderwalt/Unit_tests/actions/runs/38430798382
(harness `31fd05b`, Terje source `e65020a`, baseline `4b128e`). Continue parser,
motion and configuration gaps while it builds. Do not push small follow-ups that
cancel it. These extensions belong on the same coverage branch; goal is active.

## Batch 3 reporting and parameter checkpoint

Branch `coverage-batch-3`, unchanged Terje core `e65020a8389b19d3c03277e02f34219e25800e6a`.
The reporting/parameter extension adds 38 separate cases: real cycle/probe status,
plugin settings channel availability, lathe modal text, dimensionless scaling
reports, string reallocation preservation, persisted inactive work offsets,
coordinate-system parameters, setting metadata and numerical motion parameters.
Full Clang ASan/UBSan: **2,340 tests, 2,315 clean passes, 25 documented known
regressions, zero unexpected failures/skips**. Strict summary and all 40 Python
helper tests pass. Newly reproduced report/parameter defects and cleanup guidance
are in KNOWN_BUGS.md; original expected correct assertions remain.

The earlier 2,302-test checkpoint passed hosted GCC, Clang, coverage and diagnosis:
https://github.com/petervanderwalt/Unit_tests/actions/runs/38426592992
(harness `bcafe18`, source `e65020a`). The first hosted attempt found a Linux
printf type mismatch in test diagnostics; portable casts fixed it before this
successful run. This hosted result does not validate later unpushed cases.

Latest completed coverage snapshot, at 2,337 tests: **86.2% lines
(15,689/18,206), 91.8% functions (1,114/1,214), 72.4% branches
(8,997/12,424)**. Three subsequent spindle listing cases pass focused and full sanitizer
validation and are not included in that measurement. Next examine spindle capability reports,
then remaining parser/motion gaps. Goal remains active.

## Batch 3: Terje core and modal/storage/filesystem paths

Current coverage branch: `coverage-batch-3`, based on upstream master after PR #5
merged. Candidate source: `terjeio/grblHAL_core` master resolved to
`e65020a8389b19d3c03277e02f34219e25800e6a` on 2026-10-13. The ordinary ignored
core checkout was updated without production-source edits; no default registry
pin or submodule was introduced.

Added 48 new focused cases and restored/revalidated 12 archived parser cases.
New coverage includes nested automatic modal restoration, M71 cancellation,
spindle/coolant/feed behavior, tool persistence failure and volatile/no-storage
writes, embedded seek bounds/recovery, CAN settings/queue/fallback behavior,
polar path segmentation/angle continuity/cancellation, lathe tool geometry,
numbered tool/scaling/work parameters, and the new virtual-parameter API including
allocation failure. The two preserved unfinished modal cases are corrected and
included; G93 saves an explicit per-block F word. VFS close verifies close-before-
notification ordering and the correct filesystem pointer. Plain G71/G72 tests
verify plugin dispatch; roughing geometry stays TODO.

Terje fixed six documented issues: century leap, VFS close, embedded seek,
three-register Modbus, dynamic laser power and empty tool identities. Thirteen
obsolete allowances, their resolved entries and two obsolete diagnostic wrappers
were removed. Embedded macro return now matches only the outstanding subroutine
callback lifetime defect. Correct regression assertions remain.

New confirmed M72 override-control regression and its passing direct-restore
control are in KNOWN_BUGS.md. The archived unexpected-file-marker defect is also
restored and reconfirmed. Full Windows Clang ASan/UBSan run: **2,302 tests,
2,293 clean passes, nine known regressions, zero unexpected failures/skips**;
strict summary passes. All 40 remaining Python helper tests pass. Fresh coverage includes every new case: **85.9% lines (15,637/18,206),
91.7% functions (1,113/1,214), 72.1% branches (8,954/12,424)**. CAN reaches
all 61 executable lines and all measured branches. Polar reaches 125/136 lines;
remaining gaps are its unfinished homing/limit callbacks. Coverage-mode tests
pass with four explicitly skipped fatal-memory regressions that require ASan;
the sanitizer run executes and classifies all four. No sources are excluded to
inflate coverage. Old snapshots below use older source revisions.

Next: use the fresh coverage gaps to expand realtime reporting and repeated/plugin
settings reports, then additional parser/motion paths. The 12 archived parser
cases have been restored; the verified Git bundle remains under
`../branch-cleanup-backup-20261013/unit-tests-all-branches.bundle` for recovery.
Do not restore obsolete fixture/exception changes wholesale. Coverage work is
active on this branch; the CI/source-update sections below are historical.

## October 13 compatibility follow-up

Earlier CI/source-update work paused coverage expansion. Its
follow-up branch was `ci-terje-fix-validation`, based on merged upstream `63323b5`.
It tests Terje's core `4b128e68bc63f9a3af11a01a7d8fbb5d5ccc98aa` without changing
core source. Tool callback, check-mode, task startup and settings fixtures are
adapted. Resolved exceptions and bug entries are removed; correct assertions stay.
Remaining core regressions are documented in KNOWN_BUGS.md. See ci/VALIDATION.md
for the final verification result: 2,242 tests, 2,221 clean passes and 21
documented known regressions; zero unexpected failures under Windows Clang sanitizers.
Hosted GCC, Clang and coverage passed in run 38367839505 on harness `90c890d`. The coverage percentages below remain historical;
this compatibility run does not establish a new coverage percentage.
The two untracked modal-restore coverage cases remain unfinished and unstaged.

## Current delivery preference

The user revoked one-commit-per-test on 2026-10-12. Keep separate maintainable
case files, but commit meaningful related test batches. Focused checks precede
batch commits; full sanitizer/summary and CI checks happen at substantial push
boundaries. Do useful coverage work while CI runs rather than repeatedly polling.

## Current baseline

- Repository: https://github.com/petervanderwalt/Unit_tests, branch `master`.
- Latest verified committed/pushed revision: `d7c588316ae697213001164b1c411c3b8051c544` (prior delivery).
- Core pin: `451a539c6ed0f00499b8b48258f9aa7971fac384` from
  https://github.com/grblHAL/core. Core has not been patched locally.
- Full Windows Clang ASan/UBSan run: **2,219 tests**; **2,117 clean passes**,
  **46 passes with known sanitizer diagnostics**, **56 known regressions**,
  **0 unexpected failures**, **0 skipped**. The summary check passed too.
- Latest verified GitHub Actions run:
  https://github.com/petervanderwalt/Unit_tests/actions/runs/38290580195
  at `d7c5883`, all three jobs completed successfully. CI platform/compiler diagnostic counts
  can differ; inspect actual results instead of assuming Windows totals.
- Latest fresh merged coverage at the `b670a6f` code snapshot / 2,164 tests:
  **82.4% lines (14,985/18,178)**, **86.6% functions (1,041/1,202)**,
  **69.4% branches (8,586/12,365)** across 52 core C source files.
  Source denominators stayed unchanged. Built in a new directory to avoid old
  execution counts; merge completed with exit 0. Logs/output:
  `filesystem-fresh-coverage-summary.log`, `filesystem-fresh-coverage.json`.
  The newer 22 probe/I/O/NGC, 17 Modbus and 16 secondary-stepper tests are not included in this measurement.
- New batch through `6e7cebe`: ten probe tests exercise registered IRQ callbacks,
  latching/inversion, protection signals, fallback polling, connection events,
  per-probe trigger queries and interrupt teardown/rearm order; five I/O cases
  cover legacy assignment contracts, explicit-claim capabilities and settings
  readback; seven numbered NGC parameter cases cover probe coordinates/results,
  M66, stored G28/G30, work-system selection and G92 suspend/restore.
  Full sanitizer/strict summary passed at 2,186 cases:
  `probe-io-ngc-tests.log` and `probe-io-ngc-summary.log`.
  Missing-pin fixture corrected in `16f904f`: index 255 was invalid; the test
  now models a driver returning no pin for valid port 0. No exception added.
  G92 restoration explicitly disables volatile G92 storage in its fixture.
- Modbus RTU expanded by seventeen cases through `637bd4e`: queue flush preserves
  active transactions, resets chain driver hooks and clean up abort callbacks,
  stream readiness, baud/timeout persistence, synchronous timeout/CRC retries
  and exhaustion, serial framing, statistics/reset command, plugin reporting,
  unavailable format and blocking-event asynchronous dispatch. Full sanitizer
  and strict summary passed at 2,203 cases: `modbus-expanded-tests.log` and
  `modbus-expanded-summary.log`. The RTU blocking fixture bounds realtime polls
  and injects bytes through the actual stream; it does not emulate the protocol.
  RTU hooks are installed before initialization and reporting has an explicit
  connected-stream callback. Next substantial module: stepper2 reset, stop and
  motor callbacks, preserving existing correct known finite-motion regression.
- Secondary stepper batch through `45f77f5` adds sixteen cases: reset/stop,
  delayed foreground callbacks, settings reconfiguration, initialization failure,
  continuous speed/reverse motion, actual captured timer IRQ/rearm/stop and
  polling fallback, plus five eight-axis spindle-binding/metadata cases.
  Full sanitizer and strict summary passed at 2,219 cases:
  `secondary-expanded-tests.log` and `secondary-expanded-summary.log`.
  Explicit acceleration 36,000 is used for bounded continuous-motion tests;
  the generic host's 100 setting requires thousands of steps to reach cruise.
  The original correct finite-move overshoot regression is unchanged.
  Timer callbacks simulate IRQ delivery through captured HAL configuration,
  without duplicating motor state transitions. Next: auto-squaring homing
  pull-off workflows via `limits_pull_off()` and the existing homing fixture.
- Fresh largest remaining gaps: gcode 501 lines, settings 211, report 172,
  Modbus RTU 144, stepper2 139, motion control 128, machine limits 125,
  NGC flow control 123. Untouched functions are aggregated across variants.
  Next: auto-squaring homing pull-off and remaining limit workflows; Modbus has
  since received the batch above. Existing RTU fixture's reset
  callback must be non-NULL before RTU wraps it. No active coverage process.
- Expanded filesystem batch through `b670a6f` adds seven embedded filesystem
  tests (directory/list registration, hidden file visibility, storage totals,
  relative reads and read-only mutation protection) and six device tests
  (receive counts/EOF, claim retry/reuse, independent UART/Bluetooth ownership,
  registration prerequisites and unsupported directory operations).
  Full sanitizers plus strict summary passed at 2,164 cases:
  `filesystem-expanded-tests.log` and `filesystem-expanded-summary.log`.
- RAM filesystem batch adds nine separately committed tests through `9064721`:
  rename content preservation/errors, truncate-to-zero, open-handle deletion,
  directory enumeration/EOF, storage accounting after head/middle deletion,
  driver memory reporting, empty reset callback chaining, and flat-directory
  rejection. Full sanitizer and strict summary passed: `ram-final-tests.log`
  and `ram-final-summary.log`. RAM deletion tests explicitly make the mount
  visible because the default hidden mount rejects public mutations.
  Populated reset confirmed a stale-list use-after-free: regression `6d25ee7`
  and narrow wrapper/docs `2769903` retain safe reset/reuse assertions. Details
  and exact cleanup are in KNOWN_BUGS.md. Full sanitizer and strict summary
  passed at 2,151 cases: `ram-reset-full-tests.log` and
  `ram-reset-full-summary.log`. Prior pushed batch CI run `38287310214` at
  `f930f38` completed successfully in all three jobs.
- The prior delivery added 17 `acceleration_profiles` cases through `9501ee1`:
  G187 P1-P5 scaling of actual planned moves, validation, initialization,
  program-end resets, same-block selection and preservation of queued moves.
  Full sanitizer suite and strict summary passed; evidence:
  `acceleration-summary.log` and `acceleration-tests.log`.
- Rejected G187 commands change modal acceleration before unused-word validation.
  Two correct regressions demonstrate changed state and slower following motion;
  dated source links and exact cleanup instructions are in KNOWN_BUGS.md.
- The cutter-compensation delivery passed all three CI jobs at `3941003`.
- The jerk delivery added 23 cases through `2448c9d`: jerk ramp regimes and
  boundaries, axis limits, jog/system/synchronized exclusions, real stepper
  pulse endpoints, settings conversion/initialization/overrides, hold/resume
  and jerk combined with G187 profiles. Full sanitizers and strict summary
  passed: `jerk-feature-tests.log` and `jerk-feature-summary.log`.
  Two negative-motion tests reproduce the existing documented gcode.c numeric
  cast diagnostic; no new exception or weakened assertion was added.
- The rotation delivery added 15 rotation cases through `0f611a8`: XY/ZX/YZ
  plane transformations, normal-axis preservation, angle direction/zero,
  G53, actual motor pulses, persisted G10 rotation, reports/NGC parameters,
  absolute omitted axes and incremental explicit-zero controls.
  Full sanitizers and strict summary passed: `rotation-feature-tests.log`
  and `rotation-feature-summary.log`.
- A confirmed rotation defect adds unwanted movement for omitted incremental
  axes: after a 90-degree G55 move to local X3/Y4, G91 X2 reaches machine
  X=-8/Y=5 instead of X=-4/Y=5. Actual driver pulse regression independently
  confirms 640 instead of 320 negative X pulses. Exact cleanup links and
  dated source anchors are in KNOWN_BUGS.md; correct assertions are preserved.
- The spindle-sync delivery added 16 spindle-sync cases through `c587f8c`: encoder
  capability/PPR, settings hook forwarding and real initialization, synchronized
  Z pulse endpoints, handler reset/normal-block restoration, G95 bypass,
  two-index startup, missing-index/zero-RPM alarms, stop/reset before wakeup,
  and cruising angular feedback with configured PID. Full sanitizers and strict
  summary passed: `spindle-sync-feature-tests.log` and
  `spindle-sync-feature-summary.log`; all 16 additions passed cleanly.
- The jog/laser delivery added 14 motion-control cases through `8abf6ff`:
  real jog commands/driver pulses, temporary inch/incremental modal settings,
  feed-override suppression, queued targets, zero distance, soft-limit rejection
  and clipping; coincident M3/M4/off/nonlaser/check-mode behavior and a power
  update proven to occur only after the queued move emits all 80 X pulses.
  Full sanitizers and strict summary passed: `jog-laser-tests.log` and
  `jog-laser-summary.log`. The two negative-jog cases reproduce the existing
  documented numeric-cast diagnostic; no new exception was introduced.
- The prior delivery added 19 settings cases through `6285797`: per-axis homing
  rates/availability, auto-square offsets/availability, acceleration/travel
  conversion, persistent reload and probe/limit/parking/PWM option readback.
- Eight toolsetter workflow cases through `e03837d` exercise G59.3 positioning,
  G30 return, actual seek/locate/release probing, first/existing reference,
  travel clipping, failure cleanup and restore options. A pulse callback
  verifies XY motion occurs at retracted Z. Tool-change baseline before this
  batch was 202/343 lines (58.9%); the completed refresh measured 284/343 (82.8%).
- Full sanitizer suite and strict summary passed for all 2,132 cases:
  `settings-toolsetter-tests.log`, `settings-toolsetter-summary.log`.
- Current delivery adds nine modal-report tests through `eb3d407`: actual
  M0/M1/M2/M30 callbacks, override-disable states and actual pending manual M6.
  The parser resets program flow after callbacks, so reporting is observed
  from the real callback before that intentional reset.
- User clarified that plain G71/G72 is pending implementation, not a failure.
  Its entry moved from KNOWN_BUGS.md to TODO.md (linked in README). Both cases
  now pass by checking current rejection, no plugin dispatch and no position
  change; their expected-failure labels are removed. Fractional controls remain.
- Full suite plus strict summary passed after this correction:
  `modal-report-todo-tests.log` and `modal-report-todo-summary.log`.
- No coverage process remains active; session 51685 completed successfully.
  Temporary root `.gcov` files must not be committed or removed during a merge.
- The five value-helper and four initial file tool cases were delivered at
  `8f74f64` and passed CI. The combined host has NGC expressions and N_TOOLS=4.
- The 14 restore/probe-getter cases were delivered at `5470584` and passed CI.
- The nine feedback/soft-limit cases were delivered at `746fa1a` and passed CI.
- The 18 report cases were delivered at `4850815` and passed CI.
- The 16 protocol cases were delivered at `a4293fb` and passed CI.

The handoff documents were committed and pushed as `e88cceb`; the earlier
no-push restriction was lifted by the user's explicit commit/push request.
The full coverage goal was explicitly re-established on 2026-10-12.

## Next work

1. Read the completed settings/toolsetter coverage refresh before selecting new gaps. Prior measured gaps: settings 240 executable lines, motion control 152,
   G-code 521, report 187. Protocol is now below
   150 uncovered lines. Read the JSON for exact remaining line/branch targets.
   Current settings ranges worth inspecting include 1032-1038 (now covered by
   new soft-limit tests), 3050-3056 (plugin restore callbacks, now exercised), 1728-1733 (probe
   inversion getters, now exercised), and numeric/string formatting paths
   (decimal/string/IP callback paths now have tests too).
2. Combined NGC/tool-table file execution now checks M61 deferred-offset
   application, explicit G43/G49 precedence and no pending offset. Candidate
   M6 deferred offsets, M61 completion and validation cleanup now have tests.
   LATHE_UVW_OPTION with NGC expressions is now compiled and tested under
   `lathe_ngc`. `lathe_cycle_capture_host.h` captures a plugin replacement
   interface; it deliberately does not implement roughing geometry.
   CUTTER_COMP_ENABLE is now compiled with a configuration-capturing weak
   plugin replacement. It verifies core parsing/state and transfer of parameters,
   not compensated geometry. Further candidates: tool D0/current-tool radius,
   pre-execution hooks, cancellation modes and compound motion restrictions.
   ENABLE_ACCELERATION_PROFILES=1 and ENABLE_JERK_ACCELERATION=1 now have
   standalone and combined host configurations. Remaining candidates include
   jerk feed overrides/queued transitions, more rotation offset/arc contracts, and
   additional spindle-sync PID disturbance/timer-bound and threading execution contracts.
   SPINDLE_SYNC_ENABLE now has a measured-feedback execution host. ENABLE_PATH_BLENDING is explicitly unfinished in config.h;
   do not invent a supported contract for it.
   Use `ngc_tool_file_host.h`; settings initialization must install a valid
   settings-changed callback before reinitializing the parser.

   CSS inward travel, nonzero start, G92 offsets, alternative plane and stopped/
   zero-speed rejection have passing tests. Remaining candidates include tool
   offsets, RPM mode transitions and coordinated queue behavior. Read parser
   synchronization before assuming multiple CSS moves remain queued.
3. Investigate whether consecutive queued CSS blocks can overwrite another
   block's interpolation data. `planner.c` copies `spindle_t`, which contains a
   pointer to CSS data; it writes target/delta RPM through that pointer. This is
   **only a hypothesis**, not a confirmed bug. Parser synchronization may drain
   the queue. Establish a valid startup/control and reproducible contract before
   adding any exception or known-bug entry.
4. Use fresh gaps to tackle the large remaining sources and configurations.
   From the latest coverage snapshot, uncovered executable lines included:
   `gcode.c` 466, `settings.c` 261, `report.c` 190,
   `motion_control.c` 152. These are starting hints, not current measurements.
5. Expand supported feature configurations where source guards remain uncovered.
   Preserve genuine hardware/contract limitations explicitly; do not silently
   redefine 100% as whichever configuration is easiest to cover.

## Recent work already completed

- Delay settings: spindle on/off conversion, minimum/maximum limits, coolant
  capability, at-speed tolerance and filesystem-dependent subroutine options.
- MPG settings: baud selection mapping, invalid selection, driver rejection and
  capability gating using the runtime registered stream.
- CSS planner: start/target/delta RPM, zero and negative radius and RPM clamping.
- CSS real stepper: outward movement reduces PWM monotonically, negative radius
  retains maximum output, axial movement at zero radius retains maximum output;
  emitted axis steps are checked.
- Laser parser/stepper, delta API/homing/limits, tool table, settings-file hooks,
  program completion, thread planning and system metadata batches were delivered.
- All 24 Markdown core source links in `KNOWN_BUGS.md` now use the pinned upstream
  revision instead of broken relative submodule paths.
- README now explains core pin updates, exact exception cleanup, keeping tests
  and deleting resolved known-bug sections.

Useful fixtures for continuing:

- `tests/support/laser_program_host.h`: `prepare_pwm_program_mode(mode, check)`
  initializes a real registered PWM spindle before parser startup. Laser wrapper
  remains available; output state and PWM calls are captured.
- `tests/support/laser_stepper_host.h`: `prepare_pwm_stepper_mode(mode)` plus
  `execute_motion_program()` from `motion_program_host.h` executes real segments
  and captures axis pulses. Avoid assuming unchanged PWM triggers a new write.
- `tests/support/css_host.h`: check-mode CSS parser fixture; its output callback
  expects spindle off, so it is unsuitable for real running CSS output tests.
- `sync_parser_host.h` / `thread_plan_host.h`: measured encoder feedback and
  actual threading planner capture, with check-mode versus execution differences.
- `settings_file_host.h`, `parser_settings_host.h`, `mpg_settings_host.h`,
  `system_metadata_host.h`, `delta_api_host.h`: read startup sequencing before
  reuse. CMake specifies feature routing and linker wrappers where required.

Known issues and all removal details are maintained in `tests/KNOWN_BUGS.md`,
`tests/known_bugs.cmake`, and `tests/known_sanitizer_diagnostics.json`. Do not
maintain a second defect inventory here. Recent CSS negative G-code tests can
produce the existing narrow number-conversion diagnostic; inspect the summary
rather than treating those as clean sanitizer passes.

## Local environment used for the verified runs

These paths are machine-specific conveniences, not portable requirements:

- Workspace: `C:/Users/User/Documents/Codex/2026-10-08/https-github-com-petervanderwalt-unit-tests`
- Repository: `<workspace>/work/Unit_tests`
- Python: `C:/Python313/python.exe`
- LLVM tools: `<workspace>/work/toolchain/llvm-mingw-20261006-ucrt-x86_64/bin`
- Builds in the repository: `build-clang` (focused unsanitized cases),
  `build-asan` (full sanitizers), `build-local-coverage` (Clang coverage).
- Prepend LLVM `bin` to PowerShell `PATH` for sanitizer DLL loading.
- Local scratch scripts include `<workspace>/work/case_builder.py` (writes,
  validates and commits one case), `list_coverage_gaps.py`, and batch generators.
  They are outside Git, optional, and must be inspected before execution.
  A new agent can write cases manually with the checked-in workflow instead.
- Evidence files in scratch: `secondary-expanded-summary.log` (latest sanitizer results), `modbus-expanded-summary.log`, `probe-io-ngc-summary.log`, `filesystem-expanded-summary.log`, `ram-reset-full-summary.log`, `ram-final-summary.log`, `modal-report-todo-summary.log`, `settings-toolsetter-summary.log`, `jog-laser-summary.log`, `spindle-sync-feature-summary.log`, `rotation-feature-summary.log`, `jerk-feature-summary.log`, `acceleration-summary.log`, `cutter-feature-summary.log`, `lathe-feature-summary.log`, `ngc-file-change-summary.log`, `ngc-tools-values-summary.log`, `settings-owners-summary.log`, `feedback-soft-limits-summary.log`, `report-fields-summary.log`, `protocol-lock-summary.log`, `css-execution-summary.log`,
  `css-execution-tests.log`, `delta-laser-coverage-report.log`,
  `local-core-coverage-latest.json`. Rebuild/retest if these are missing or stale.
- Local gcovr 8.4 was installed under `<workspace>/work/coverage-python`; an
  ordinary `python -m pip install gcovr==8.4` is the portable README alternative.

For the existing Windows sanitizer build:

```powershell
$env:PATH = (Resolve-Path '../../work/toolchain/llvm-mingw-20261006-ucrt-x86_64/bin').Path + ';' + $env:PATH
cmake -S . -B build-asan
cmake --build build-asan --parallel 6
ctest --test-dir build-asan --parallel 6 --output-on-failure --output-junit results.xml
C:/Python313/python.exe scripts/summary.py tests build-asan/results.xml
```

Check each command's exit status before continuing or committing. Capture CMake
output with `*> logfile` to include stderr warnings. Windows Clang coverage used
`--gcov-executable 'llvm-cov gcov'` with the compiler directory on PATH; the
space-separated absolute Windows executable path caused parsing trouble locally.
Never remove coverage data while a merge runs. A merge can take several minutes;
continue independent work without changing headers under an active build.

The testing goal is active, with no token budget. No scheduled background continuation was configured. A fresh chat should read
these files, verify current state, and be explicitly asked to resume the full
coverage objective; do not assume deleting a chat schedules future execution.
