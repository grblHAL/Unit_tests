# Coverage progress and continuation handoff

Last verified: **2026-10-12**. Read this with the root `AGENTS.md` and README.
This is a snapshot, not proof that future checkouts or CI runs are unchanged.

## Current baseline

- Repository: https://github.com/petervanderwalt/Unit_tests, branch `master`.
- Latest verified committed/pushed revision: `4850815600e415074b9a436453d58fa5cf8df94e`.
- Core pin: `451a539c6ed0f00499b8b48258f9aa7971fac384` from
  https://github.com/grblHAL/core. Core has not been patched locally.
- Full Windows Clang ASan/UBSan run: **1,952 tests**; **1,861 clean passes**,
  **42 passes with known sanitizer diagnostics**, **49 known regressions**,
  **0 unexpected failures**, **0 skipped**. The summary check passed too.
- Latest verified GitHub Actions run:
  https://github.com/petervanderwalt/Unit_tests/actions/runs/38252616638
  at `4850815`, completed successfully. CI platform/compiler diagnostic counts
  can differ; inspect actual results instead of assuming Windows totals.
- Latest merged coverage at `6ed3c20` / 1,943 tests:
  **80.1% lines (14,229/17,765)**, **84.2% functions (1,003/1,191)**,
  **67.0% branches (8,076/12,059)** across 52 core C source files.
  The merge completed successfully; scratch log: `protocol-report-coverage.log`.
  Nine subsequent cases are not included in that measurement.
- Current delivery adds nine cases through `e788dc5`: commanded versus measured
  spindle RPM, stopped/fixed-speed spindle status, unknown override dispatch,
  soft-limit homing prerequisite, configured travel filtering and disable cleanup.
  Full sanitizer suite and strict summary passed.
- The 18 report cases were delivered at `4850815` and passed CI.
- The 16 protocol cases were delivered at `a4293fb` and passed CI.

The handoff documents were committed and pushed as `e88cceb`; the earlier
no-push restriction was lifted by the user's explicit commit/push request.
The full coverage goal was explicitly re-established on 2026-10-12.

## Next work

1. Continue settings gaps (261 executable lines at the measured snapshot),
   motion control (152), G-code (466), and report (190). Protocol is now below
   150 uncovered lines. Read the JSON for exact remaining line/branch targets.
   Current settings ranges worth inspecting include 1032-1038 (now covered by
   new soft-limit tests), 3050-3056 (plugin restore callbacks), 1728-1733 (probe
   inversion getters), and numeric/string formatting paths.
2. CSS inward travel, nonzero start, G92 offsets, alternative plane and stopped/
   zero-speed rejection have passing tests. Remaining candidates include tool
   offsets, RPM mode transitions and coordinated queue behavior. Read parser
   synchronization before assuming multiple CSS moves remain queued.
3. Investigate whether consecutive queued CSS blocks can overwrite another
   block's interpolation data. `planner.c` copies `spindle_t`, which contains a
   pointer to CSS data; it writes target/delta RPM through that pointer. This is
   **only a hypothesis**, not a confirmed bug. Parser synchronization may drain
   the queue. Establish a valid startup/control and reproducible contract before
   adding any exception or known-bug entry.
4. Use fresh gaps to tackle the large remaining sources and configurations.
   From the latest coverage snapshot, uncovered executable lines included:
   `gcode.c` 466, `settings.c` 261, `report.c` 190,
   `motion_control.c` 152. These are starting hints, not current measurements.
5. Expand supported feature configurations where source guards remain uncovered.
   Preserve genuine hardware/contract limitations explicitly; do not silently
   redefine 100% as whichever configuration is easiest to cover.

## Recent work already completed

- Delay settings: spindle on/off conversion, minimum/maximum limits, coolant
  capability, at-speed tolerance and filesystem-dependent subroutine options.
- MPG settings: baud selection mapping, invalid selection, driver rejection and
  capability gating using the runtime registered stream.
- CSS planner: start/target/delta RPM, zero and negative radius and RPM clamping.
- CSS real stepper: outward movement reduces PWM monotonically, negative radius
  retains maximum output, axial movement at zero radius retains maximum output;
  emitted axis steps are checked.
- Laser parser/stepper, delta API/homing/limits, tool table, settings-file hooks,
  program completion, thread planning and system metadata batches were delivered.
- All 24 Markdown core source links in `KNOWN_BUGS.md` now use the pinned upstream
  revision instead of broken relative submodule paths.
- README now explains core pin updates, exact exception cleanup, keeping tests
  and deleting resolved known-bug sections.

Useful fixtures for continuing:

- `tests/support/laser_program_host.h`: `prepare_pwm_program_mode(mode, check)`
  initializes a real registered PWM spindle before parser startup. Laser wrapper
  remains available; output state and PWM calls are captured.
- `tests/support/laser_stepper_host.h`: `prepare_pwm_stepper_mode(mode)` plus
  `execute_motion_program()` from `motion_program_host.h` executes real segments
  and captures axis pulses. Avoid assuming unchanged PWM triggers a new write.
- `tests/support/css_host.h`: check-mode CSS parser fixture; its output callback
  expects spindle off, so it is unsuitable for real running CSS output tests.
- `sync_parser_host.h` / `thread_plan_host.h`: measured encoder feedback and
  actual threading planner capture, with check-mode versus execution differences.
- `settings_file_host.h`, `parser_settings_host.h`, `mpg_settings_host.h`,
  `system_metadata_host.h`, `delta_api_host.h`: read startup sequencing before
  reuse. CMake specifies feature routing and linker wrappers where required.

Known issues and all removal details are maintained in `tests/KNOWN_BUGS.md`,
`tests/known_bugs.cmake`, and `tests/known_sanitizer_diagnostics.json`. Do not
maintain a second defect inventory here. Recent CSS negative G-code tests can
produce the existing narrow number-conversion diagnostic; inspect the summary
rather than treating those as clean sanitizer passes.

## Local environment used for the verified runs

These paths are machine-specific conveniences, not portable requirements:

- Workspace: `C:/Users/User/Documents/Codex/2026-10-08/https-github-com-petervanderwalt-unit-tests`
- Repository: `<workspace>/work/Unit_tests`
- Python: `C:/Python313/python.exe`
- LLVM tools: `<workspace>/work/toolchain/llvm-mingw-20261006-ucrt-x86_64/bin`
- Builds in the repository: `build-clang` (focused unsanitized cases),
  `build-asan` (full sanitizers), `build-local-coverage` (Clang coverage).
- Prepend LLVM `bin` to PowerShell `PATH` for sanitizer DLL loading.
- Local scratch scripts include `<workspace>/work/case_builder.py` (writes,
  validates and commits one case), `list_coverage_gaps.py`, and batch generators.
  They are outside Git, optional, and must be inspected before execution.
  A new agent can write cases manually with the checked-in workflow instead.
- Evidence files in scratch: `feedback-soft-limits-summary.log` (latest sanitizer results), `report-fields-summary.log`, `protocol-lock-summary.log`, `css-execution-summary.log`,
  `css-execution-tests.log`, `delta-laser-coverage-report.log`,
  `local-core-coverage-latest.json`. Rebuild/retest if these are missing or stale.
- Local gcovr 8.4 was installed under `<workspace>/work/coverage-python`; an
  ordinary `python -m pip install gcovr==8.4` is the portable README alternative.

For the existing Windows sanitizer build:

```powershell
$env:PATH = (Resolve-Path '../../work/toolchain/llvm-mingw-20261006-ucrt-x86_64/bin').Path + ';' + $env:PATH
cmake -S . -B build-asan
cmake --build build-asan --parallel 6
ctest --test-dir build-asan --parallel 6 --output-on-failure --output-junit results.xml
C:/Python313/python.exe scripts/summary.py tests build-asan/results.xml
```

Check each command's exit status before continuing or committing. Capture CMake
output with `*> logfile` to include stderr warnings. Windows Clang coverage used
`--gcov-executable 'llvm-cov gcov'` with the compiler directory on PATH; the
space-separated absolute Windows executable path caused parsing trouble locally.
Never remove coverage data while a merge runs. A merge can take several minutes;
continue independent work without changing headers under an active build.

The testing goal is active, with no token budget. No scheduled background continuation was configured. A fresh chat should read
these files, verify current state, and be explicitly asked to resume the full
coverage objective; do not assume deleting a chat schedules future execution.
